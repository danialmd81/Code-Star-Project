# OpenTelemetry: Production-Ready Observability Guide

## What is OpenTelemetry?

**OpenTelemetry (OTel)** is an open-source framework for collecting, processing, and exporting telemetry data (metrics, logs, traces) from applications and infrastructure. It standardizes observability across languages and platforms, making it easier to monitor distributed systems.

- **Telemetry:** Data about system behavior (metrics, logs, traces).
- **Metrics:** Numeric measurements (CPU, memory, request count).
- **Logs:** Text records of events.
- **Traces:** End-to-end request flows across services.

---

## Why Use OpenTelemetry?

- **Unified Observability:** Collects metrics, logs, and traces in a consistent way.
- **Vendor Neutral:** Works with many backends (Prometheus, Jaeger, Zipkin, Grafana, etc.).
- **Cloud Native:** Designed for microservices, containers, and cloud platforms.
- **Extensible:** Supports custom instrumentation and integrations.

## OpenTelemetry Architecture

```
+-------------------+      +-------------------+
|   Instrumented    | ---> |   OTel Collector  | ---> | Backend (Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.) |
|   Applications    |      +-------------------+      +------------------------------------+
| (SDKs, Agents)    |             |                                      
+-------------------+             v
                          +-------------------+
                          |   Processors      |
                          +-------------------+
```

- **Instrumented Applications:** Use OTel SDKs to generate telemetry.
- **OTel Collector:** Central service to receive, process, and export telemetry.
- **Backends:** Where data is stored and visualized (Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.).

---

## Key Components

### 1. OpenTelemetry SDKs

- **Purpose:** Integrate with your application code to generate telemetry.
- **Languages:** Go, Java, Python, .NET, Node.js, etc.
- **Example:**  

  ```python
  from opentelemetry import trace
  tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
  ```

### 2. OpenTelemetry Collector

- **Purpose:** Receives telemetry, processes it, and exports to backends.
- **Modes:** Agent (runs with app), Gateway (centralized).
- **Configurable:** Pipelines for metrics, logs, traces.

---

## Collector Configuration (`config.yaml`)

The OTel Collector uses a YAML config file to define pipelines. Main sections:

### 1. Receivers

Define how data is received (protocols, endpoints).

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
  prometheus:
    config:
      scrape_configs:
        - job_name: 'otel-collector'
          static_configs:
            - targets: ['localhost:8888']
```

- **OTLP:** OpenTelemetry Protocol (gRPC/HTTP).
- **Prometheus:** Scrapes metrics from endpoints.

### 2. Processors

Modify or batch telemetry data.

```yaml
processors:
  batch:
    timeout: 10s
    send_batch_size: 512
  memory_limiter:
    check_interval: 1s
    limit_mib: 128
    spike_limit_mib: 32
```

- **batch:** Groups data for efficient export.
- **memory_limiter:** Prevents collector from using too much memory.

### 3. Exporters

Send data to external systems.

```yaml
exporters:
  prometheus:
    endpoint: "0.0.0.0:8889"
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  otlp:
    endpoint: "jaeger:4317"
    tls:
      insecure: true
```

- **prometheus:** Exposes metrics for scraping.
- **logging:** Logs telemetry for debugging.
- **otlp:** Sends data to other OTel-compatible systems (e.g., Jaeger).

### 4. Service

Defines pipelines for metrics, traces, logs.

```yaml
service:
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp, prometheus]
      processors: [batch, memory_limiter]
      exporters: [prometheus]
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch, memory_limiter]
      exporters: [otlp]
```

## Production Considerations

### 1. Resource Management

- **Memory/CPU Limits:**  
  Set limits in Docker/Swarm/Kubernetes to avoid resource exhaustion.
- **Batching:**  
  Use batch processor to reduce network load.

### 2. High Availability

- **Collector Gateway:**  
  Run multiple collector instances behind a load balancer.
- **Stateless:**  
  Collector is stateless; scale horizontally.

### 3. Security

- **TLS:**  
  Enable TLS for OTLP endpoints.
- **Authentication:**  
  Use reverse proxies for auth if needed.
- **Network:**  
  Restrict access to collector endpoints.

### 4. Monitoring the Collector

- **Prometheus Exporter:**  
  Scrape collectorâ€™s own metrics for health and performance.

### 5. Integration

- **Backends:**  
  Export to Prometheus (metrics), Jaeger/Zipkin (traces), Loki (logs).
- **Service Discovery:**  
  Use dynamic configs for cloud/K8s environments.

## Example: Docker Compose Integration

Your `docker-compose.yml` includes an `otel-collector` service:

- **Volumes:** Mounts config file.
- **Networks:** Connects to monitoring and ETL networks.
- **Healthcheck:** Ensures collector is running.
- **Resource Limits:** Prevents overuse.

---

## Common Pitfalls

- **No batching:** Causes high network usage.
- **Unrestricted endpoints:** Security risk.
- **Missing exporters:** Data not sent to backends.
- **No resource limits:** Collector can crash host.

---

## Best Practices

- Always set resource limits.
- Secure endpoints with TLS and network policies.
- Use batch and memory_limiter processors.
- Monitor collector health via Prometheus.
- Document all pipelines and integrations.
