## Radmehr's Tasks

1. **CI/CD Selection & Implementation**
   - Evaluate and choose between Jenkins CI and GitHub Actions for the project.
   - Design, implement, and maintain the CI/CD pipeline for automated build, test, and deployment.

### Notes

- All tasks should align with the Docker Swarm architecture and ETL pipeline described in the referenced files and diagrams.
- Collaboration is required for integration points (e.g., Keycloak with Backend, monitoring with CI/CD).
- Documentation and best practices should be maintained for future scalability and onboarding.
