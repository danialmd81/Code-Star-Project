# ETL Project Implementation Guide - Phase by Phase

## Phase 1: Project Introduction & Setup

In this initial phase, you need to:

1. **Understand ETL Fundamentals**:
   - Familiarize yourself with Extract, Transform, Load concepts
   - Practice using ETL tools like Knime with the provided COVID data example

2. **Set up Development Environment**:
   - Provision servers with recommended specs (4+ CPU cores, 8GB+ RAM, 50GB+ storage)
   - Configure Docker and Docker Compose environments
   - Configure HTTPS, backups, and user access
   - Create necessary directory structures and configuration files

3. **Plan DevOps Infrastructure**:
   - Establish branching strategy (dev, test, main)
   - Create CI/CD pipeline templates
   - Configure monitoring for the infrastructure

## Phase 2: Authentication

In this phase, you'll implement user management:

1. **Deploy Keycloak**:
   - Set up Keycloak as a Docker container with HTTPS/SSL
   - Configure it for three user roles: System Administrator, Data Manager, and Analyst
   - Share connection details with development teams
   - Connect frontend application to Keycloak using the same Docker network

2. **Implement CI/CD Pipelines**:
   - Design and implement CI/CD pipelines for automatic builds and tests
   - Set up Docker image publication to a registry
   - Create Kubernetes manifests for deploying each team's images

3. **Configure Development Environments**:
   - Provide separate development, test, and production environments
   - Ensure Keycloak instances are isolated between environments

## Phase 3: Data Loading

This phase focuses on implementing the Load part of ETL:

1. **Database Infrastructure**:
   - Deploy PostgreSQL instances for development teams
   - Configure access control for team independence
   - Implement automatic backups for production data
   - Ensure data restoration capabilities

2. **Security Measures**:
   - Implement security features to prevent DoS attacks
   - Work with development teams on data validation
   - Test system resilience through simulated attacks
   - Set up monitoring for unusual database activity

3. **DevOps Support**:
   - Help development teams implement database operations
   - Configure backup automation with tools like `pg_dump` and `cron`
   - Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus or Grafana

## Phase 4: Data Operations

In this phase, you'll implement the Transform part of ETL:

1. **Spark Deployment**:
   - Deploy Apache Spark according to security standards
   - Make Spark available to all development teams
   - Ensure proper configuration for dynamic SparkSQL generation

2. **Observability Implementation**:
   - Deploy observability infrastructure based on OpenTelemetry
   - Integrate observability tools with products
   - Set up monitoring dashboards for data processing operations

3. **Pipeline Support**:
   - Help teams implement data pipeline functionality
   - Support filter and aggregation plugin development
   - Ensure scalable processing architecture

## Overall DevOps Responsibilities

Throughout all phases, you'll need to:

1. **Kubernetes Infrastructure**:
   - Maintain container orchestration
   - Ensure scalability and high availability
   - Manage service discovery and networking

2. **CI/CD Pipeline Maintenance**:
   - Support automated building, testing, and deployment
   - Implement quality gates (security scans, automated tests)
   - Manage deployment promotion across environments

3. **Observability Stack**:
   - Maintain OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Jaeger
   - Configure alerts and notifications
   - Support teams with instrumentation

4. **Security Implementation**:
   - Enforce HTTPS/SSL for all communications
   - Support role-based access control through Keycloak
   - Implement secure database configurations
   - Ensure data validation and sanitization

5. **Docker Compose Network Configuration**:
   - Ensure proper network configuration between services
   - Maintain connectivity between frontend and authentication services
   - Implement proper security within Docker networks
